# Introduction
You're a boomer and you still store your songs locally? (Or you're not a boomer but for whatever reason you do that?)   
And the songs directory is messy and you suffer from OCD?   
Pfff I got u.   
# Functionality  
This program looks into a directory and first creates sub-directories for each artist.   
And then in each artist directory, it creates sub-directories for albums.  
And at the end it puts the songs in the corresponding directory.   
That's how you get your OCD satisfied. :)
